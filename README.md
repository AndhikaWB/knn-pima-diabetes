# KNN from Scratch
An attempt to make KNN (K-nearest neighbors) algorithm from scratch for [PIMA Indians Diabetes](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database) dataset.

## Features
* Written in pure Python
* Minimal libraries (`csv`, `statistics`, `copy`)
* Convert zero to null (for use with imputer)
* Imputer (fill null values with mean/median/mode from closest neighbors)
* Predict class and regression test (find the most optimal number of neighbors)
* K-fold cross validation (divide 1 dataset into X parts and test the accuracy)
* Import and export dataset from/to CSV file (with/without label)
